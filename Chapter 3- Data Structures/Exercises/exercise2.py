## Exercise 2: Greetings :ballot_box_with_check:

"""Start with the list you used in Exercise 1, but instead of just printing each person's name, 
print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be 
personalized with the person's name."""

name = ['Alekz', 'Sam', 'Seif', 'Mariez']

print (f'Hey! What time is your next class, {name[0]}?')
print (f'Hey! What time is your next class, {name[1]}?')
print (f'Hey! What time is your next class, {name[2]}?')
print (f'Hey! What time is your next class, {name[3]}?')
