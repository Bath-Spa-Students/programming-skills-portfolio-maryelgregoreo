# Exercise 5: Change Guest List 

# Inviting to dinner

guests = ["Chaewon", "Yunjin", "Kazuha"]

print(f'Hey! Can I take you out to dinner, {guests [0]}?')
print(f'{guests [1]}! Want to go to dinner with me?')
print(f'{guests [2]}, Would you like to go to dinner with me?')

print(f'Oh! {guests [0]} cannot make it to dinner, she is sick.. Let us invite Sakura instead!')

# Chaewon can't make it so let's invite Sakura

guests [0] = "Sakura"

print(f'Hey {guests [0]}! Chaewon cannot make it to dinner, would you like to come instead?')
