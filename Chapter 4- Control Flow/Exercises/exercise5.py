## Exercise 5: Favorite Fruit 

#Only the listed in favorite_fruits will be printed

favorite_fruits = ["grapes", "banana", "orange"]

if "apple" in favorite_fruits:
    print("Oh! You must really like apples!")

if "grapes" in favorite_fruits:
    print("Oh! You must really like grapes!")

if "mango" in favorite_fruits:
    print("Oh! You must really like mango!")

if "tangerine" in favorite_fruits:
    print("Oh! You must really like tangerine!")

if "banana" in favorite_fruits:
    print("Oh! You must really like banana!")

# apple, mango and tangerine is not printed since it's not listed in favorite_fruits variable
